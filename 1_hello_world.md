# Hello World

Try to run the all-too-famous Hello World below
```python runnable
print('Hello World!')
```

Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. (run below code first, then remove the leading spaces before "print" statement and see what happens)

```python runnable
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
```
