# Learn Python in 1 Day Lesson Overview

This course is expanded on [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) on w3schools.com. Please review its [Python Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) and [Python Get Started](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp)

w3schools is a great place to learn web technologies, but this http://tech.io platform provides realtime online code running IDE, and for this reason this is a better place to tinker, and learn.

```python runnable
print('Hello World!')
```

Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. (run below code first, then remove the leading spaces before "print" statement and see what happens)

```python runnable
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
```
